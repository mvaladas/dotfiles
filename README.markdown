# Usage
Put this in your vimrc along with your personal hacks:

`source ~/.vim/vimrc      "linux`

`source ~/vimfiles/vimrc  "windows`

These vim settings use vim-plug to install the plugins.

On the very first run execute the command:

`:PlugInstall`

# Fonts
You will need to install a NERD Font to use the glyphs properly
